    <string name="currency_factss">Crane and Co., a Massachusetts-based company, has been providing the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing with paper for U.S. currency since 1879. Federal Reserve notes are a blend of 25 percent linen and 75 percent cotton. Currency paper has tiny red and blue synthetic fibers of various lengths evenly distributed throughout the paper. It would take 4,000 double folds, forwards and backwards, to tear a banknote. No matter the denomination, a banknote weighs approximately 1 gram. Because there are 454 grams in one pound, this means there are 454 notes in one pound of currency. Want to measure your notes in a different way? A stack of currency one mile high would contain more than 14.5 million banknotes. It is estimated that between one-half to two-thirds of the value of all U.S. currency in circulation is outside of the U.S.</string>
